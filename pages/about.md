I am now a second-year master's student in CNU(Capital Normal University).  If all goes well, I will graduate in the summer of 2026. Before that, I was an undergraduate student in the Department of Mathematics at CNU.

My interest lies in complex geometry and complex analysis.

I am (slowly) writing a Notes on Pluripotential theory and singular KE metric. This covers almost all the topics of the SCV seminar that I (and my advisor) hosted at CNU.
